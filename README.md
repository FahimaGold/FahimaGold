I've once also used CodeIgniter for a web application. Recently, I started using typescript, and just started learning Kotlin, as part of an android scholarship offered by Google via PluralSight. Besides, I've recently finished a nano-degree from udacity as a cloud developer in which we used AWS, microservices, and serverless.
