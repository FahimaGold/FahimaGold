#### Fahima Mokhtari
Hey there!

<!--
**FahimaGold/FahimaGold** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a software engineer, currently based in Algeria.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently mainly focused on testing, clean code, performance, scaling, RPC\RMI, and IPC. Up to now, I've been writing bash scripts, using python for automation, machine learning and image processing, Java for desktop and android apps, php, html, css3, javascript, and nodejs for web apps. I've once also used CodeIgniter for a web application. Recently, I started using typescript, and just started learning Kotlin. Besides, I've recently finished a nano-degree from udacity as a cloud developer in which we used AWS, microservices, and serverless. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any backend project.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™d love to work on any IoT project (Haven't done much in IoT so far, but I'd love to work on a real world project in the future)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email: df_mokhtari@esi.dz
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Friends call me with several nicknames and I don't mind, but I prefer my first name, Fahima. (She/Her)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Other than coding, I'm a curious girl who's eagerly into knowledge and solving problems, fitness enthusiast, thinker, art lover, passionate about cultures, love reading and cooking too...
